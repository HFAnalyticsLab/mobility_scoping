# Residential mobility in England and Wales
Project Status: [completed]

## Project Description
Residential mobility - people moving where they live between local areas in the UK - is one factr shaping health in local areas. People who are young and in good helath tend to move to areas where many other young and healthy people live. This has the potential to reinforce existing geographic inequalities in health.

This analysis aims to describe residential mobility in England and Wales, according to self-reported health, age and economic activity. We also aimed to identify different types of residential mobility for local authorities, and compare the prevalence of overweight/obesity and common mental health disorders between local authorities of each residential mobility type. 

## Outputs
The findings have been published on the Health Foundation website [add URL].

## Data source
We used open, area-level [detailed migration data](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/sources/census_2011_ukmigration) from the 2011 Census.
